# KIDNEY-DISEASE-DETECTION-AGENT
This project predicts chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a Random Forest model trained on clinical data. After removing null values and encoding categories, the model achieves high accuracy. Built with Python and Scikit-learn, it runs smoothly in Google Colab for easy use and testing.
